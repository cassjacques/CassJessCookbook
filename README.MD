Cass and Jessâ€™ foodSaver Recipe App User Story

## Scope:

To build an application where users can store their favorite recipes and sort them by type of meal, in addition to editing and deleting stored recipes. 

## User story:

Users will be met with a landing page prompting for USERNAME and PASSWORD login information with a button to log in, as well as a button to signup. 

New users who need to create an account will be directed to a signup page prompting for a USERNAME, EMAIL, and PASSWORD fields to create an account. Once an account has been created, the user will be redirected to the landing page to log in.

The user will then be directed to a profile page where they can add a recipe, add a sorting type, and a dropdown menu with available sorting types and a button for type selection. Vegetarian and meat options are the two default sorting types, but users have the ability to add additional sorting types on the profile page. Users can also log out on this page. 

Once the user selects a sorting type, the confirmation button will direct the user to a page displaying all of the recipes assigned to that type. Clicking on a recipe will redirect the user to a page showing information for the saved recipe, as well as buttons to edit or delete the individual recipe.
